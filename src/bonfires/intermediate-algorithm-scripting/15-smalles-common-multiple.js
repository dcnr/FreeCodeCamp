/* Bonfire: Smallest Common Multiple
 * http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-smallest-common-multiple
 *
 * Find the smallest common multiple of the provided parameters that
 * can be evenly divided by both, as well as by all sequential numbers
 * in the range between these parameters.
 *
 * The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily
 * be in numerical order.
 *
 * e.g. for 1 and 3 - find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3
 * that is evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3.
